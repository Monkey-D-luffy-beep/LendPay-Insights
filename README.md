Project Overview
Objective:
To analyze our lending and repayment data to identify key trends, performance metrics, and actionable insights.

Key Areas Covered:

Anchor-Wise Lending Summary:
Understand the distribution of total disbursed amounts, available limits, and average interest rates across different lending anchors.

State-Wise Analysis:
Compare total disbursement, receivable amounts, and repayment performance by state to identify regional trends and potential risk areas.

Industry-Wise Analysis:
Dive into the data by industry, examining disbursed amounts, available limits, and average tenure. This helps in recognizing which sectors are driving our portfolio.

Repayment Analysis:
Break down received amounts, overdue repayments, and repayment cycles to highlight patterns in repayment behavior.

Advanced Analysis (Penalty Ratio & Delay Patterns):
Use calculated fields to measure the Penalty Ratio and identify accounts with high-risk profiles, guiding more effective follow-up and risk mitigation strategies.
